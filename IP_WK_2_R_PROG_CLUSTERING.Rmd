## Data Source

The dataset source link: http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset

## Reading Data

```{r}
# Loading and reading data from source link
#
library(tidyverse)
brand <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset")

# Previewing the head of data
#
head(brand)
```
```{r}
# Previewing tail of data
#
tail(brand)

```
```{r}
# Checking the data structure 
#
str(brand)
```
*The dataset has 12330 observations (rows) and 18 variables(columns)
*The data types are appropriately represented

```{r}
# Looking at the columns
#
library(tidyverse)
colnames(brand)
```
## Data Cleaning

```{r}
# looking at data summary 
#
summary(brand)

```
* there are some NA values which will need be imputed

```{r}
## Calling Amelia and mice libraries for data imputation
#
library(Amelia)
library(mice)
library(VIM)
```
```{r}
## Confirming if the data has missing
#
mapply(anyNA,brand)
```

```{r}
# Imputing the missing values by predicting missing values with mice package
# 

miss_mod <- mice(brand[, c("Administrative" , "Administrative_Duration", "Informational", "Informational_Duration", "ProductRelated", "ProductRelated_Duration", "BounceRates", "ExitRates")], method='rf')

completed <- complete(miss_mod)

```
```{r}
# placing predicted missing values into the main data set
# ---
# 
brand$Administrative <- completed$Administrative

brand$Month <- match(Month,month.abb)
tail(brand)
```

```{r}
# Removing class label before label encoding
# 
df <- brand[,c(1:17)]
head(df)


```



```{r}
# Standardising the data 
#
data <- df %>% select(-VisitorType, -Weekend, -Month) %>%  scale()
head(data)
```
## K-Means Clustering

```{r}
# Determining the optimal value of k
#
library(factoextra)
fviz_nbclust(data, kmeans, method= "silhouette")
```
* The optimal k value is 3.

```{r}
# Applying the K-means at k=3
# ---
# 
k_clust<- kmeans(data,3) 

# Previewing the no. of records in each cluster
# 
k_clust$size


```
```{r}
# Visualizing the  clustering results
#
fviz_cluster(kmeans(data, centers = 3), data = data)
```
```{r}
# displaying the results in a table
#
brand.class<- brand[, "VisitorType"]
table(k_clust$cluster, brand.class)
```

## Hierarchical

```{r}
# computing the Euclidean distance between observations, 
#
df <- dist(data, method = "euclidean")

# hierarchical clustering using the complete method
# 
hc <- hclust(df, method = "complete" )

hc

```

```{r}
# plotting adendrogram
# 
plot(hc)
rect.hclust(hc, k = 10, border = 2:5)

```

## DBSCAN Clustering

```{r}
# getting optimum eps
#
library(fpc)
library(dbscan)
kNNdistplot(data, k=3) 
abline(h = 3, lty=2)
```

```{r}
# Applying dbscan algorithm with the optimal eps = 3
#
db <- dbscan(data,eps=3,MinPts = 4)
db
```

```{r}
# Plotting DBSCAN
#

hullplot(data,db$cluster)
```

```{r}
#dispalying the cluster results in a table

table(db$cluster, brand.class)
```
## conclusion

We conclude that returning visitors are most likely to generate revenue 
Pagevalue through out the year showed revenue was being genenaated.
